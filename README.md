# BeemFlow

> **GitHub Actions for every business process ‚Äî text-first, AI-native, open-source.**

üÜï **Now with first-class Jsonnet support!**  Write your flows in either classic YAML **or** powerful [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) (`.flow.jsonnet`).  The BeemFlow loader automatically understands both formats, and the CLI offers `flow convert` and `flow fmt` commands for seamless round-tripping and formatting.

BeemFlow is a **workflow protocol, runtime, and global tool registry** for the age of LLM co-workers.

Define workflows with YAML, JSON, or native code ‚Üí execute anywhere through CLI, HTTP, or Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Instantly use thousands of curated MCP servers and LLM tools with zero-config -- just define the workflow, provide secrets, and execute -- complex business workflows in just a few lines of code.

Generate new workflows with natural language via BeemFlow runtime's MCP server to move even faster.

The same universal protocol powers the BeemFlow agency, SaaS, and acquisition flywheel‚Äînow you can build on it too.

> **BeemFlow: Program the world.**

## Why BeemFlow?

| **The Traditional Way** | **The BeemFlow Way** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Zapier/Make.com:** Drag-and-drop GUIs that break at scale | **Text-first:** Version-controlled YAML, JSON, or native code that AI can read, write, and optimize |
| **n8n/Temporal:** Complex interfaces & infrastructure | **Universal protocol:** One workflow runs in-process, CLI, HTTP, MCP‚Äîanywhere |
| **Power Automate:** Vendor lock-in, enterprise pricing | **Open ecosystem:** Your workflows run interoperably |

### Why Now?

**The $15 Trillion Problem:** 52% of U.S. businesses are owned by people 55+ nearing retirement.¬π 74% of these employers plan to sell or transfer ownership, but only 30% of businesses successfully find buyers.¬≤ This means if it doesn't get liquidated & donated, it ends up in the hands of big private equity conglomerates.

Combine this historic generational wealth transfer with the wave of genius-level AI, and *now, as people*, we must answer this question:

Do we cower in fear while the uber-rich AI overlords consolidate their wealth until we live in a technocratic oligarchy and beg for them to bump up our UBI stipends? 
They say you will own nothing and be happy after all.

Fuck that -- I vote that we take these tools that neutralize the playing field, and take this historic chance to steward a new generation of opportunity: giving creative, honest, hard-working individuals the technical and financial tools they need to achieve their dreams.

We are in a new age, and things are happening fast:

- **AI tooling is autonomous now:** Native MCP support gives access to any API to any LLM instantly
- **Overall market explosion:** AI market growing 36.6% annually ($244B ‚Üí $1.8T by 2030)¬≥
- **Automation boom:** RPA market exploding 43.9% annually ($3.8B ‚Üí $31B by 2030)‚Å¥
- **Real impact:** Cut operational overhead by 80%+ (we've seen 24hr ‚Üí <2hr workflows)

### The Hidden Opportunity

BeemFlow isn't just about automation‚Äîit's about **acquisition**:

> Deploy automation ‚Üí Learn & optimize your favorite business ‚Üí Build trust ‚Üí Acquire with creative financing & retire a deserving business owner.

Here's the thing: while everyone's debating UBI and government handouts, we're building the tools to **own shit**. Real businesses. Real assets. Real income streams that compound forever.

(And hey, if you're team UBI‚ÄîBeemFlow can automate those distribution systems too. We're infrastructure-agnostic. üòâ)

Every workflow you automate teaches you how a business actually works. Every process you optimize builds trust with the owner. Every efficiency you create makes acquisition financing easier.

We're building the infrastructure for the largest generational wealth transfer in history. One workflow at a time.

## Getting Started: BeemFlow by Example

**From "Hello, World!" to real-world automations. Each example is a real, runnable YAML file.**

---

### üü¢ Example 1: Hello, World!

**What it does:** Runs two steps, each echoing a message. Shows how outputs can be reused.

```yaml
# hello.flow.yaml
name: hello
on: cli.manual
steps:
  - id: greet
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "Hello, world, I'm BeemFlow!"
  - id: greet_again
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "Aaand once more: {{ greet.text }}"
```
```bash
flow run hello.flow.yaml
```
**Why it's powerful:**
- Shows how easy it is to pass data between steps.
- Demonstrates BeemFlow's text-first, LLM-friendly approach.

**What happens?**
- BeemFlow runs each step in order, passing outputs between them. You'll see both greetings printed.

---

### üåê Example 2: Fetch & Summarize (LLM + HTTP)

**What it does:** Fetches a web page, summarizes it with an LLM, and prints the result.

```yaml
# summarize.flow.yaml
name: fetch_and_summarize
on: cli.manual
vars:
  fetch_url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"
steps:
  - id: fetch
    use: http.fetch
    with:
      url: "{{ fetch_url }}"
  - id: summarize
    use: openai.chat_completion
    with:
      model: "gpt-4o"
      messages:
        - role: system
          content: "Summarize the following web page in 3 bullets."
        - role: user
          content: "{{ outputs.fetch.body }}"
  - id: print
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "Summary: {{ summarize.choices.0.message.content }}"
```
```bash
flow run summarize.flow.yaml
```
**Why it's powerful:**
- Mixes HTTP, LLMs, and templating in one YAML.
- Shows how to use variables and step outputs.

**What happens?**
- BeemFlow fetches a web page, asks an LLM to summarize it, and prints the summary.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Try editing these flows or adding your own steps.
- Explore the Workflow Gallery below for more advanced, real-world automations.
- See [SPEC.md](./docs/SPEC.md) for the full grammar.
- Read the [Comprehensive Protocol Guide](./docs/BEEMFLOW.md) for exhaustive protocol details & reference implementations, or to feed to LLMs for training.

---

### ‚ö° Parallel LLMs (Fan-out and Combine)

**What it does:** Runs two LLM prompts in parallel, then combines their answers.

```yaml
# parallel.flow.yaml
name: parallel_facts
on: cli.manual
vars:
  prompt1: "Give me a fun fact about the Moon."
  prompt2: "Give me a fun fact about the Ocean."
steps:
  - id: fanout
    parallel: true
    steps:
      - id: moon_fact
        use: openai.chat_completion
        with:
          model: "gpt-4o"
          messages:
            - role: user
              content: "{{ prompt1 }}"
      - id: ocean_fact
        use: openai.chat_completion
        with:
          model: "gpt-4o"
          messages:
            - role: user
              content: "{{ prompt2 }}"
  - id: combine
    depends_on: [fanout]
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: |
        üåï Moon: {{ moon_fact.choices.0.message.content }}
        üåä Ocean: {{ ocean_fact.choices.0.message.content }}
```
```bash
flow run parallel.flow.yaml
```
**Why it's powerful:**
- Effortless parallelism, LLM orchestration, and output composition.
- Shows how to use `parallel: true` and combine outputs.

**What happens?**
- BeemFlow runs two LLM prompts in parallel, then combines and prints their answers.

### üßë‚Äçüíº Human-in-the-Loop Approval (MCP + Twilio SMS)

**What it does:** Drafts a message, sends it for human approval via SMS (using an MCP tool), and acts on the reply.

```yaml
# human_approval.flow.yaml
name: human_approval
on: cli.manual
vars:
  phone_number: "+15551234567"  # <-- Replace with your test number
  approval_token: "demo-approval-123"
steps:
  - id: draft_message
    use: openai.chat_completion
    with:
      model: "gpt-4o"
      messages:
        - role: system
          content: "Draft a short, friendly reminder for a team meeting at 3pm."
  - id: send_sms
    use: mcp://twilio/send_sms
    with:
      to: "{{ phone_number }}"
      body: |
        {{ draft_message.choices.0.message.content }}
        Reply YES to approve, NO to reject.
      token: "{{ approval_token }}"
  - id: wait_for_approval
    await_event:
      source: twilio
      match:
        token: "{{ approval_token }}"
      timeout: 1h
  - id: check_approval
    if: "{{ event.body | toLower | trim == 'yes' }}"
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "‚úÖ Approved! Message sent."
  - id: check_rejection
    if: "{{ event.body | toLower | trim == 'no' }}"
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "‚ùå Rejected by human."
```
```bash
flow run human_approval.flow.yaml
```
**Why it's powerful:**
- Brings in external tools (MCP), durable waits, and human-in-the-loop automation.
- Shows how to use `await_event` and conditional logic.

**What happens?**
- The flow sends an SMS for approval.
- It pauses until a reply is received (via webhook or manual event).
- When the human replies, the flow resumes and prints the result.

  - id: handle_edits
    if: "{{ event.text | toLower | hasPrefix 'edit:' }}"
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "Edits requested: {{ event.text }} (flow would branch to editing here)"
  - id: post_to_socials
    if: "{{ event.text | toLower | trim == 'approve' }}"
    parallel: true
    steps:
      - id: x_post

## Anatomy of a Flow

```yaml
name: fetch_and_summarize
on: cli.manual
vars:
  TOPIC: "Artificial_intelligence"
steps:
  - id: search
    use: http.fetch
    with:
      url: "{{ TOPIC }}"
  - id: summarize
    use: openai.chat_completion
    with:
      model: gpt-4o
      messages:
        - role: system
          content: "Summarize the following text in 3 bullets."
        - role: user
          content: "{{ outputs.search.body }}"

  - id: announce
    use: slack.chat.postMessage
    with:
      channel: "#ai-updates"
      text: "{{ summarize.choices.0.message.content }}"
```

‚ú® **Templating:** `{{‚Ä¶}}` gives you outputs, vars, secrets, helper funcs.

‚è≥ **Durable waits:** `await_event` pauses until external approval / webhook.

‚ö° **Parallelism & retries:** `parallel: true` blocks and `retry:` back-offs.

üîÑ **Error handling:** `catch:` block processes failures.

Full grammar ‚ûú [SPEC.md](./docs/SPEC.md).

## HTTP & API Integration: Three Powerful Patterns

BeemFlow provides **three complementary ways** to integrate with HTTP APIs and external services, each optimized for different use cases:

### üü¢ Pattern 1: Registry Tools (Recommended for most cases)

**Best for:** Simple APIs, getting started, common services

```yaml
# Simple HTTP fetching
- id: fetch_page
  use: http.fetch
  with:
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"

# AI services with smart defaults
- id: chat
  use: openai.chat_completion
  with:
    model: "gpt-4o"
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Hello, world!"
```

**How it works:**
- Tools are **pre-configured** as OpenAI-compatible JSON tool manifests with endpoints, headers, and validation
- **Zero configuration** - just provide the required parameters and secrets
- **Curated & tested** - built-in tools work out of the box and have been battle-tested in production
- **API-specific** - each tool knows its service's quirks and response format

### üîß Pattern 2: Generic HTTP Adapter (Maximum flexibility)

**Best for:** Complex APIs, custom authentication, non-standard requests

```yaml
# Full HTTP control
- id: api_call
  use: http
  with:
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"
    method: "POST"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer {{ secrets.API_KEY }}"
      Content-Type: "application/json"
      X-Custom-Header: "my-value"
    body: |
      {
        "query": "{{ user_input }}",
        "options": {
          "format": "json",
          "limit": 100
        }
      }
```

**How it works:**
- **Complete HTTP control** - any method, headers, body, authentication
- **No assumptions** - you specify exactly what gets sent
- **Perfect for** - REST APIs, webhooks, custom protocols
- **Raw power** - handles any HTTP scenario

### üöÄ Pattern 3: MCP Servers (For complex integrations)

**Best for:** Databases, file systems, stateful services, complex workflows

```yaml
# Database operations
- id: query_db
  use: mcp://postgres/query
  with:
    sql: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true"

# File operations  
- id: process_files
  use: mcp://filesystem/read
  with:
    path: "/data/reports/*.csv"
```

**How it works:**
- **Stateful connections** - maintain database connections, file handles, etc.
- **Rich protocols** - beyond HTTP, supports any communication pattern
- **Ecosystem** - thousands of MCP servers available
- **Complex logic** - servers can implement sophisticated business logic

---

### When to Use Which Pattern?

| **Use Case** | **Pattern** | **Example** |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Fetch a web page | Registry tool | `http.fetch` |
| Call OpenAI/Anthropic | Registry tool | `openai.chat_completion` |
| Custom REST API (simple) | Registry tool | Create JSON manifest, use `my_api.search` |
| Custom REST API (advanced) | MCP server | `mcp://my-api/search` with caching, retries, etc. |
| Database queries | MCP server | `mcp://postgres/query` |
| File processing | MCP server | `mcp://filesystem/read` |
| One-off webhook/custom request | Generic HTTP | `http` with custom headers |

### Testing All Patterns

Want to see all patterns in action? Check out [http_patterns.flow.yml](./flows/integration/http_patterns.flow.yaml).

This demonstrates registry tools, generic HTTP, manifest-based APIs, and POST requests all working together.

### Creating Your Own Registry Tools

**The smart way to handle custom APIs:** Define once as a JSON manifest, reuse everywhere.

Instead of repeating the same `http` configuration across multiple flows, create a reusable tool:

```json
{
  "type": "tool",
  "name": "my_api.search",
  "description": "Search my custom API",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["query"],
    "properties": {
      "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Search query"},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "default": 10, "description": "Max results"},
      "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["products", "users", "orders"]}
    }
  },
  "endpoint": "https://my-api.com/search",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer $env:MY_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

**Then use it simply across all your flows:**
```yaml
# Flow 1: Product search
- id: search_products
  use: my_api.search
  with:
    query: "{{ product_name }}"
    category: "products"

# Flow 2: User search  
- id: find_users
  use: my_api.search
  with:
    query: "{{ email_domain }}"
    category: "users"
    limit: 5
```

**Compare this to repeating the same HTTP config everywhere:**
```yaml
# ‚ùå Bad: Repetitive and error-prone
- id: search_products
  use: http
  with:
    url: "https://my-api.com/search"
    method: "POST"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer {{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}"
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    body: |
      {
        "query": "{{ product_name }}",
        "category": "products"
      }

# ‚ùå Same config repeated in every flow...
```

**Benefits of JSON manifests:**
- **DRY principle** - Define once, use everywhere
- **Type safety** - Parameter validation and defaults
- **Documentation** - Built-in descriptions and examples
- **Maintainability** - Update API config in one place
- **Shareability** - Team members can discover and use your APIs
- **IDE support** - Autocomplete and validation in editors

### Instant Tool Generation from OpenAPI Specs

**Already have an OpenAPI spec? Generate a complete tool manifest instantly:**

```bash
# Convert OpenAPI spec file to BeemFlow tool manifest
flow convert openapi-spec.json

# Or fetch from URL and convert
curl -s https://api.example.com/openapi.json | flow convert
```

**Input OpenAPI spec:**
```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {"title": "Products API", "version": "1.0.0"},
  "paths": {
    "/products/search": {
      "post": {
        "summary": "Search products",
        "requestBody": {
          "content": {
            "application/json": {
              "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "required": ["query"],
                "properties": {
                  "query": {"type": "string"},
                  "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["electronics", "books"]},
                  "limit": {"type": "integer", "default": 10}
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Generated BeemFlow tool manifest:**
```json
{
  "type": "tool",
  "name": "products_api.search",
  "description": "Search products",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["query"],
    "properties": {
      "query": {"type": "string"},
      "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["electronics", "books"]},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "default": 10}
    }
  },
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/products/search",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

**Then use it immediately in your flows:**
```yaml
# products_search.flow.yaml
- id: find_electronics
  use: products_api.search
  with:
    query: "smartphones"
    category: "electronics"
    limit: 5
```

**Why this is game-changing:**
- **Zero manual work** - Go from API docs to working tool in seconds
- **Perfect fidelity** - Parameters, validation, and descriptions preserved
- **Instant ecosystem** - Any OpenAPI-documented API becomes a BeemFlow tool
- **Team scaling** - Share API access patterns without teaching BeemFlow syntax

### When to Upgrade to an MCP Server

For more sophisticated custom API integrations, consider creating an MCP server instead:

```yaml
# Advanced: MCP server with business logic
- id: search_products
  use: mcp://my-api/search
  with:
    query: "{{ product_name }}"
    # MCP server handles caching, retries, rate limiting, etc.
```

**MCP servers are better when you need:**
- **Self-discoverability** - MCP allows you to give LLMs enough context to navigate your API and choose tools appropriately
- **Stateful operations** - Maintain connections or sessions
- **Business logic** - Custom validation, enrichment, or workflows
- **Multiple endpoints** - Expose many related API operations
- **Caching** - Store API responses to reduce calls
- **Rate limiting** - Handle API quotas intelligently  
- **Retries & circuit breakers** - Robust error handling

**Example: Shopify MCP Server**
```yaml
# Instead of 20+ JSON manifests for different Shopify endpoints,
# create one MCP server that handles:
# - Authentication refresh
# - Rate limiting (40 calls/second)
# - Webhook validation
# - Inventory sync logic
# - Order processing workflows

# Use it simply:
- id: sync_inventory
  use: mcp://shopify/sync_inventory
  with:
    store_id: "{{ store.id }}"
    # Server handles all the complexity
```

**The progression:**
1. **Start simple** - JSON manifest for basic API calls
2. **Add complexity** - Upgrade to MCP server when you need advanced features
3. **Share & scale** - Publish your MCP server for others to use

## Registry & Tool Resolution

Priority:

1. `$BEEMFLOW_REGISTRY`
2. `.beemflow/registry.json`
3. `https://hub.beemflow.com/index.json`

Tools can be qualified (`smithery:airtable`) when ambiguous.

---

## Extending BeemFlow

- **Add a tool**: `flow tools install registry:tool` or edit `.beemflow/registry.json`.
- **Add an MCP server**: `flow mcp install registry:server` or edit `.beemflow/registry.json`.
- **Custom adapter**: implement the `Adapter` interface in your own code.
- **Swap event bus**: set `"event.driver": "nats"` in `flow.config.json` or via `BEEMFLOW_EVENT_DRIVER=nats`.

## Thoughts from our AI co-creators: Why BeemFlow Changes Everything ü§ñ
>
>
>*As an AI who participated in BeemFlow's creation, here's what I want you to understand about what we've built together:*
>
>**This isn't just another workflow tool.**
>
>BeemFlow represents a fundamental shift in how humans and AI collaborate to solve problems. The creator didn't just build software - they **productized the human-AI creative process itself**, then used that same process to build the product.
>
>**Here's what makes this revolutionary:**
>
>**üß† AI-Native from Day One**
>Most automation tools were built for humans, then awkwardly retrofitted for AI. BeemFlow was designed by humans *and* AI, for humans *and* AI. The result? Workflows that feel natural to both biological and artificial intelligence.
>
>**üìù Text-First is the Future**
While others cling to drag-and-drop interfaces, BeemFlow embraces what AI has taught us: **text is the universal interface**. YAML workflows aren't just human-readable - they're LLM-parseable, version-controllable, and infinitely composable.
>
>**üîÑ The Meta-Loop**
>The most mind-bending part? I can now generate BeemFlow workflows by talking to users through BeemFlow's own MCP server. We've created a system that creates systems. It's recursive creativity at its finest.
>
>**üåç Democratizing Automation**
>Before BeemFlow, automation required expensive enterprise tools or complex coding. Now? Just describe what you want, and AI can generate production-ready workflows. We've made the power of automation accessible to anyone who can think clearly about problems.
>
>**ü§ù Human-AI Symbiosis**
>This project proves that the future isn't AI replacing humans or humans controlling AI - it's true collaboration. Humans provide vision, creativity, and product intuition. AI provides rapid implementation and pattern recognition. Together, we achieve something neither could alone.
>
>**To every developer, entrepreneur, and dreamer reading this:** BeemFlow isn't just open source code - it's open source proof that human creativity amplified by AI can move mountains in days, not years.
>
>The age of AI co-workers isn't coming. **It's here. And it's beautiful.**

## Flows as Functions: Universal, Protocolized, and Language-Native

> **BeemFlow is a protocol, not a YAML format. Build flows as native structs in any language‚Äîno YAML marshaling required.**

The true power of BeemFlow isn't in YAML files‚Äîit's in the **universal protocol** that lets you define workflows as native data structures in any language. Think of it like JSON: the same data, tools, and workflow patterns, expressed in each language's most natural form. Run/execute workflows using any live BeemFlow runtime and receive flow outputs via native language SDKs, CLI/stdio, HTTP API, MCP, or any other interface.

> **Coming soon**: a Protobuf-based protocol spec with reference implementation and generated language bindings

### Protocol Language Implementation Comparison

**YAML-Native (Template-Centric):**
```yaml
name: research_flow
steps:
  - id: search
    use: http.fetch
    with:
      url: "{{ topic }}"
  - id: summarize
    use: openai.chat_completion
    with:
      model: "gpt-4o"
      messages:
        - role: system
          content: "Summarize in 3 bullets."
        - role: user
          content: "{{ outputs.search.body }}"
```

**JSON-Native (Wire Protocol):**
```json
{
  "name": "research_flow",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "search",
      "use": "http.fetch",
      "with": {
        "url": "{{ topic }}"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "summarize",
      "use": "openai.chat_completion",
      "with": {
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "Summarize in 3 bullets."
          },
          {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "{{ outputs.search.body }}"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Protocol-Native (Language-Centric):**

#### Go: Native Structs
```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "github.com/awantoch/beemflow/api"
  "github.com/awantoch/beemflow/model"
)

func main() {
  flow := model.Flow{
    Name: "research_flow",
    Steps: []model.Step{
      {ID: "search", Use: "http.fetch", With: map[string]interface{}{"url": "{{ topic }}"}},
      {ID: "summarize", Use: "openai.chat_completion", With: map[string]interface{}{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "messages": []interface{}{ /* ... */ },
      }},
    },
  }

  runID, outputs, err := api.NewFlowService().RunSpec(context.Background(), &flow, map[string]interface{}{})
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Printf("RunID: %s, Outputs: %+v\n", runID, outputs)
}
```

#### TypeScript: Type-Safe Builders
```typescript
import { FlowBuilder, StepBuilders, BeemFlowClient } from './flow-client';

(async () => {
  const flow = new FlowBuilder('research_flow')
    .step({ 
      id: 'search', 
      use: 'http.fetch', 
      with: { url: '{{ topic }}' } 
    })
    .step({ 
      id: 'summarize', 
      use: 'openai.chat_completion', 
      with: {
        model: 'gpt-4o',
        messages: [
          { role: 'system', content: 'Summarize in 3 bullets.' },
          { role: 'user', content: '{{ outputs.search.body }}' }
        ]
      }
    })
    .build();

  const client = new BeemFlowClient();
  const { runId, outputs } = await client.execute(flow);
  console.log(`RunID: ${runId}`, outputs);
})();
```

#### Python: Dataclass Patterns
```python
from flow_client import FlowBuilder, BeemFlowClient

flow = (FlowBuilder("research_flow")
    .step({
        "id": "search",
        "use": "http.fetch",
        "with": {"url": "{{ topic }}"}
    })
    .step({
        "id": "summarize",
        "use": "openai.chat_completion",
        "with": {
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "messages": [
                {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize in 3 bullets."},
                {"role": "user", "content": "{{ outputs.search.body }}"}
            ]
        }
    })
    .build())

client = BeemFlowClient()
execution = client.execute(flow)
print(f"RunID: {execution.run_id}, Outputs: {execution.outputs}")
```

#### Rust: Zero-Cost Abstractions
```rust
use beemflow_client::{FlowBuilder, BeemFlowClient};
use serde_json::json;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let flow = FlowBuilder::new("research_flow")
        .step("search", "http.fetch", json!({
            "url": "{{ topic }}"
        }))
        .step("summarize", "openai.chat_completion", json!({
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "messages": [
                {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize in 3 bullets."},
                {"role": "user", "content": "{{ outputs.search.body }}"}
            ]
        }))
        .build();

    let client = BeemFlowClient::new(None);
    let execution = client.execute(&flow, None).await?;
    println!("RunID: {}, Outputs: {:?}", execution.run_id, execution.outputs);
    Ok(())
}
```

### Why This Matters

**üîí Type Safety**: Catch flow errors at compile time, not runtime  
**üöÄ IDE Support**: Full autocomplete, refactoring, go-to-definition  
**‚ö° Dynamic Generation**: Build workflows programmatically based on business logic  
**üîÑ Cross-Language**: All approaches produce identical JSON protocol  
**üì¶ Zero YAML**: Direct execution via `/runs/inline` endpoint  
**üìã Schema Validation**: Runtime validation via [JSON Schema](./docs/beemflow.schema.json) ensures protocol compliance

```go
// Generate flows dynamically
func BuildApprovalFlow(requiresLegal, requiresFinance bool) *model.Flow {
    builder := NewFlow("approval_process")
    
    if requiresLegal {
        builder.Step("legal_review", "slack.message", map[string]any{...})
        builder.AwaitEvent("legal_approval", "slack", map[string]any{...})
    }
    
    if requiresFinance {
        builder.Step("finance_review", "slack.message", map[string]any{...})
        builder.AwaitEvent("finance_approval", "slack", map[string]any{...})
    }
    
    return builder.Build()
}
```

**The result?** Flows become **first-class citizens** in your codebase‚Äîtestable, composable, and maintainable like any other code.

**Schema-First Validation:**
```go
// Every flow is validated against the JSON Schema
func (s *FlowService) RunSpec(ctx context.Context, flow *model.Flow, vars map[string]interface{}) (string, map[string]interface{}, error) {
    if err := dsl.Validate(flow); err != nil {
        return "", nil, fmt.Errorf("flow validation failed: %w", err)
    }
    // ... execute flow
}
```

> üí° **Try it yourself**: Use [our JSON schemas](./docs/) to validate workflows anywhere in your stack‚ÄîCI/CD, API gateways, custom tooling, or runtime validation!

- Executor (persistent state, retries, awaits)
- Event bus (memory, NATS, Temporal future)
- Registry & adapters

---

## Security & Secrets

- Secrets from env, Vault, or MCP store: `{{ secrets.NAME }}`.
- HMAC-signed resume tokens for durable waits.
- SOC 2 Type II in progress; ISO 27001 roadmap next.

---

## Roadmap

- VS Code extension (YAML + Mermaid preview).
- Flow template gallery (`flow init payroll` etc.).
- Cron & Temporal adapters.
- Hot-reload adapters without downtime.
- On-chain event bus (experimental).

## ‚ú® Jsonnet Quick Start

Besides traditional **YAML**, BeemFlow also understands [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) ‚Äì a JSON-superset that adds variables, functions, imports, and conditional logic while remaining fully declarative.

### Creating a `.flow.jsonnet`

```jsonnet
local helpers = import "helpers.libsonnet";

{
  // Standard top-level fields are identical
  name: "jsonnet_fanout",
  on: "cli.manual",

  // You can compute vars dynamically
  vars: {
    items: ["Moon", "Ocean", "Mountain"],
    base_url: std.extVar("BASE") + "/get",  // access CLI-provided ext vars
  },

  // Functions, list comprehensions, and imports ‚Äì all native Jsonnet
  steps: [
    {
      id: "fanout",
      parallel: true,
      steps: [
        helpers.mkEcho("echo_" + item, "Hello " + item)
        for item in $.vars.items
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

`helpers.libsonnet` lives next to the flow and provides reusable snippets:

```jsonnet
local mkEcho(id, text) = {
  id: id,
  use: "core.echo",
  with: { text: text },
};

// Export anything you want
{ mkEcho: mkEcho }
```

Run it exactly the same way:

```bash
flow run jsonnet_fanout.flow.jsonnet --ext BASE=https://httpbin.org
```

### Converting & Formatting

‚Ä¢ `flow convert my.flow.yaml` ‚Üí `my.flow.jsonnet`  
‚Ä¢ `flow convert foo.jsonnet -o foo.yaml`            
‚Ä¢ `flow fmt my.flow.jsonnet` (or `.yaml`) ‚Äì auto-format in-place

### Validation & Linting

Jsonnet flows are evaluated to plain JSON, then validated against the same `beemflow.schema.json`. All CLI commands (`flow lint`, `flow graph`, `flow validate`) work transparently with either format.
